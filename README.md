# Gradient Frequency Neural Networks with Tensorflow #

Work in progress. This project implements Gradient Frequency Neural Networks (GrFNNs) with tensorflow 2 and python 3. The examples included here reproduce the results shown in https://github.com/MusicDynamicsLab/GrFNNToolbox/tree/master/Examples.

The goal is to use tensorflow's automatic differentiation to optimize GrFNN parameters. Tensorflow GPU support is also included. A keras GrFNN class will also be written.
